# Data Management Strategy

## Data Architecture

### Core Data Models

#### User Profiles
- Customer Profile
  ```typescript
  {
    id: string
    email: string
    fullName: string
    phone: string
    location: GeoPoint
    role: 'customer'
    createdAt: Timestamp
    lastActive: Timestamp
  }
  ```

- Service Provider Profile
  ```typescript
  {
    id: string
    businessName: string
    email: string
    phone: string
    services: string[]
    location: GeoPoint
    role: 'provider'
    rating: number
    verified: boolean
    documents: Document[]
  }
  ```

**Reasoning**: The user profile models are structured to:
- Separate customer and provider roles clearly
- Store only essential personal information
- Enable efficient location-based queries
- Support rating and verification systems
- Maintain POPIA compliance

#### Service Management
- Quote
  ```typescript
  {
    id: string
    customerId: string
    providerId: string
    serviceType: string
    description: string
    attachments: string[]
    status: QuoteStatus
    amount: number
    validUntil: Timestamp
    createdAt: Timestamp
  }
  ```

- Service
  ```typescript
  {
    id: string
    category: string
    name: string
    description: string
    basePrice: number
    providerId: string
  }
  ```

**Reasoning**: The service and quote models are designed to:
- Enable flexible pricing models
- Support multiple service types
- Track quote lifecycle
- Allow attachments for detailed quotes
- Maintain audit trail of changes

#### Transactions
- Booking
  ```typescript
  {
    id: string
    quoteId: string
    customerId: string
    providerId: string
    status: BookingStatus
    scheduledDate: Timestamp
    amount: number
    paymentStatus: PaymentStatus
  }
  ```

**Reasoning**: The transaction structure ensures:
- Clear payment tracking
- Service delivery verification
- Financial reconciliation
- Dispute resolution support
- Audit compliance

### Firebase Collection Structure
```typescript
/users/{userId} // User profiles
/providers/{providerId} // Service provider profiles
/services/{serviceId} // Available services
/quotes/{quoteId} // Quote requests
/bookings/{bookingId} // Service bookings
/reviews/{reviewId} // User reviews
/chats/{chatId} // Chat rooms
/messages/{chatId}/messages/{messageId} // Chat messages
/transactions/{transactionId} // Payment transactions
/categories/{categoryId} // Service categories
```

**Reasoning**: The collection structure was designed to:
- Optimize query performance
- Support real-time updates
- Enable efficient data access patterns
- Maintain data relationships
- Scale effectively with growth

### Database Design
#### Schema Relationships
- Users -> Quotes (1:n)
- Providers -> Services (1:n)
- Quotes -> Bookings (1:1)
- Users/Providers -> Reviews (1:n)
- Users -> Chats (n:n)

**Reasoning**: These relationships were chosen to:
- Minimize data duplication
- Support efficient queries
- Enable data integrity
- Allow for future expansion
- Maintain clear data ownership

#### Indexing Strategy
- Location-based queries
  - Provider location
  - Service area coverage
- Status-based queries
  - Quote status
  - Booking status
- Date-based queries
  - Booking schedules
  - Transaction history

**Reasoning**: Our indexing approach prioritizes:
- Fast location-based searches
- Efficient status filtering
- Quick date-range queries
- Optimal query performance
- Cost-effective data access

#### Query Optimization
- Compound indexes for common queries
- Denormalization for frequent reads
- Pagination implementation
- Document size limits

**Reasoning**: These optimizations ensure:
- Responsive user experience
- Efficient data retrieval
- Reduced Firebase costs
- Scalable performance
- Better resource utilization

## Data Security
### Encryption
- At-rest encryption using Firebase encryption
- SSL/TLS for data in transit
- Secure key management in Firebase
- End-to-end encryption for chats

**Reasoning**: Our encryption strategy focuses on:
- Protecting sensitive user data
- Meeting regulatory requirements
- Securing communication channels
- Preventing unauthorized access
- Supporting secure backups

### Access Control
```typescript
// Example Firebase Security Rules
{
  "rules": {
    "users": {
      "$uid": {
        ".read": "$uid === auth.uid",
        ".write": "$uid === auth.uid"
      }
    },
    "quotes": {
      "$quoteId": {
        ".read": "auth.uid === data.customerId || auth.uid === data.providerId",
        ".write": "auth.uid === data.customerId || auth.uid === data.providerId"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Reasoning**: Firebase security rules are structured to:
- Enforce data access boundaries
- Implement role-based access
- Prevent unauthorized modifications
- Enable secure sharing
- Support audit requirements

### Compliance
