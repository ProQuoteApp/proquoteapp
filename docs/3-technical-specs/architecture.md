# ProQuote Technical Architecture

## System Overview
ProQuote uses a React Native mobile application with a modern cloud backend, enabling cross-platform deployment while maintaining native-like performance and a single codebase.

**Reasoning**: This architecture was chosen to maximize market reach while minimizing development complexity and cost. React Native provides near-native performance while allowing us to maintain a single codebase for both iOS and Android platforms, significantly reducing development time and maintenance overhead.

## Technology Stack

### Mobile Applications (Cross-Platform)
- Framework: React Native
- Language: TypeScript
- Minimum Versions:
  - iOS: 14.0+
  - Android: API 26+
- State Management: Redux Toolkit
- Navigation: React Navigation
- UI Components: Native Base
- Forms: React Hook Form

**Reasoning**: React Native was selected over native development or Flutter because:
- Large pool of React/React Native developers in South Africa
- Shared codebase reduces development time and costs
- Strong ecosystem of libraries for business applications
- Excellent integration with Firebase
- TypeScript provides robust type safety and better maintainability

### Backend (Cloud Services)
- Platform: Firebase
  - Authentication
  - Cloud Firestore
  - Cloud Functions
  - Cloud Storage
  - Analytics

- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Compliance with South African data protection laws
- Regular security audits and updates

## Integration Points
- Payment Gateways (Stripe/PayFast)
- Maps Services (Google Maps)
- Push Notification Services
- Analytics Integration
- Customer Support Tools

**Reasoning**: Third-party integrations were chosen based on:
- Reliability in the South African market
- Cost-effectiveness
- API stability and documentation
- Local support availability
- Market penetration

## Scalability
- Automatic scaling with Firebase
- Performance monitoring
- Load balancing
- Geographic distribution

**Reasoning**: Our scalability strategy focuses on:
- Automatic scaling through Firebase
- Cost-effective resource utilization
- Geographic distribution for performance
- Minimal operational overhead
